# Explanation of Provided Files for BOP-Based 6D Pose Estimation

This document summarizes the meaning and purpose of each file you provided, followed by a high-level guide to training a model for 6D pose estimation based on validation images.

---

## üìÅ `dataset_info.md`
**Purpose**: Provides metadata about the dataset structure and contents.

- **Objects**: 10 different object classes are used.
- **Modalities**:
  - 3 IPS cameras: Capture image, depth, AOLP, and DOLP.
  - 1 Photoneo depth camera: Captures image and depth.
- **Scene Splits**: Indicates which objects appear in which scene IDs.
- **Reference**: CVPR 2024 paper describing the dataset.

---

## üìÅ `camera_cam1.json`, `camera_cam2.json`, `camera_cam3.json`, `camera_photoneo.json`
**Purpose**: Intrinsic camera calibration parameters for each sensor.

Fields:
- `fx`, `fy`: Focal lengths.
- `cx`, `cy`: Principal point coordinates.
- `depth_scale`: Scaling factor for depth values.
- `width`, `height`: Resolution of the images.

---

## üìÅ `test_targets_bop19.json`
**Purpose**: Specifies which objects appear in which scene/image for evaluation.

Fields (per entry):
- `scene_id`: Scene index.
- `im_id`: Image ID in that scene.
- `obj_id`: Object ID present in that image.
- `inst_count`: Number of object instances (not always used directly in evaluation).

---

## üìÅ `README.md`
**Purpose**: Instructions for participating in the OpenCV Bin-Picking Challenge.

Highlights:
- Participants must implement a 6D pose estimator node in ROS 2 (`get_pose_estimates`).
- Docker-based submission using a provided interface.
- Tester node evaluates the estimator by feeding it test scenes and saving predictions.

---

## üìÅ `bop_file_format_spec.md`
**Purpose**: Defines the structure of the dataset files in BOP format.

Key files:
- `scene_camera_camX.json`: Intrinsics + extrinsics per frame.
- `scene_gt_camX.json`: Ground-truth 6D poses of objects.
- `scene_gt_info_camX.json`: Metadata (bounding boxes, visibility, etc.)

# üß† How to Train a Model for 6D Pose Estimation

## 1. Prepare the Data
You need RGB(D)+AOLP+DOLP images and object masks (not provided above). The BOP format expects per-image files and annotations:
- Extract training images and labels.
- Use `scene_gt_camX.json` as labels (object poses).
- Use `scene_camera_camX.json` for intrinsics/extrinsics.

## 2. Choose Model Architecture
Options:
- **PoseCNN**
- **PVNet**
- **CosyPose**
- **GDR-Net**
- **EPOS**

Choose based on whether you want RGB-only or RGB-D, and multi-view support.

## 3. Train the Model
- Input: RGBD (or RGB+AOLP+DOLP) image.
- Output: 6D pose of object(s) ‚Üí [Rotation (3√ó3), Translation (3,)]

Training steps:
1. Parse dataset into training tuples (image, object ID, GT pose).
2. Preprocess images (resize, normalize, augment).
3. Define loss:
   - ADD-S, ADD-L1
   - Reprojection error
   - Point matching loss
4. Train on your selected architecture using PyTorch or TensorFlow.

## 4. Evaluate on Validation Split
- Load test images (given by scene/image pairs in `test_targets_bop19.json`)
- For each, run your model and predict pose.
- Save result in BOP format ‚Üí `scene_id`, `im_id`, `obj_id`, `R`, `t`, `score`.

## 5. Use ROS Wrapper for Submission
- Implement ROS service `/get_pose_estimates` to wrap your model.
- Use Docker to containerize it.
- Test it locally using `bpc test`.
